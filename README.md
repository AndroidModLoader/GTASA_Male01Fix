# What am i?
This is a port of a mod that tries to fix the appearance of Male01 (the model that is used when it's failed to load any other ped model).
It doesnt fix it completely but works very well!

This version is a bit different from PC. It doesnt fix the Male01 for all **vehicles** such as emergency peds (they should be fine anyway).
